# Integrating and Using `fk_user_agent` in Your Flutter Project

The `fk_user_agent` package provides easy access to detailed user agent properties in your Flutter applications. This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate and utilize `fk_user_agent` in your project.

4. [Example Implementation](#example-implementation)
5. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

## Installation

To get started with `fk_user_agent`, add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  fk_user_agent: ^2.1.0
```

Run `flutter pub get` to install the new dependency.

## Initialization

Before you can fetch user agent properties, you need to initialize the `FkUserAgent`. This should be done early in your app’s lifecycle, typically in the `initState` method of your main widget.

### Step-by-Step Initialization

1. **Import the package:**

    ```dart
    import 'package:fk_user_agent/fk_user_agent.dart';
    ```

2. **Initialize `FkUserAgent` in `initState`:**

    ```dart
    @override
    void initState() {
      super.initState();
      WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((timeStamp) async {
        await FkUserAgent.init();
        initPlatformState();
      });
    }
    ```

## Fetching User Agent Properties

After initializing `FkUserAgent`, you can access the user agent properties. This can be done in any method or widget where you need the information.

### Example Code to Fetch and Print Properties

Create a method to fetch and print the user agent properties:

```dart
Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
  try {
    if (kDebugMode) {
      print("User Agent Properties: ${jsonEncode(FkUserAgent.properties)}");
    }
  } on PlatformException {
    if (kDebugMode) {
      print("Failed to get platform version.");
    }
  }

  if (!mounted) return;
}
```

## Example Implementation

Here's a full example demonstrating the initialization and fetching of user agent properties:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fk_user_agent/fk_user_agent.dart';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((timeStamp) async {
      await FkUserAgent.init();
      initPlatformState();
    });
  }

  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    try {
      if (kDebugMode) {
        print("User Agent Properties: ${jsonEncode(FkUserAgent.properties)}");
      }
    } on PlatformException {
      if (kDebugMode) {
        print("Failed to get platform version.");
      }
    }

    if (!mounted) return;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('fk_user_agent Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Check console for user agent properties'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using `fk_user_agent`, consider the following steps:

- Ensure that you have added `fk_user_agent` to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get`.
- Make sure you have initialized `FkUserAgent` before attempting to access its properties.
- Check for any platform-specific restrictions or permissions that might affect user agent retrieval.

### Common Errors

- **PlatformException:** This might occur if the platform does not support certain user agent properties. Handle this exception gracefully in your code.
- **Null Properties:** Ensure that `FkUserAgent.init()` has completed successfully before accessing properties.

By following this guide, you should be able to effectively integrate and utilize `fk_user_agent` in your Flutter application to gather detailed user agent information.
